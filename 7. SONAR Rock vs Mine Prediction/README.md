**SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction**

- **Description:** A small classification project using the Sonar dataset to distinguish rocks from metal mines. The analysis and modeling are contained in the notebook `Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb` and the dataset is `sonar data.csv`.

**Dataset:**
- **Source:** Local file `sonar data.csv` (raw features are sonar signal intensities; labels: 'R' for rock, 'M' for mine)
- **Shape:** See the notebook for details and exploratory plots.

**Contents:**
- **Notebook:** `Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb` — full EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data:** `sonar data.csv` — raw dataset used by the notebook.

**How to use**
- Open the notebook with Jupyter Lab/Notebook or VS Code and run the cells in order.
- Recommended workflow:
  1. Install dependencies (see Requirements).
  2. Launch Jupyter: `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`.
  3. Open `Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb` and run cells.

**Requirements**
- Python 3.8+ (tested)
- Common packages used:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - jupyter

Install quickly with pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

**Modeling approach**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of sonar signal features.
- Preprocessing including scaling and label encoding.
- Train/test split and evaluation using classification models (examples in the notebook include Logistic Regression and tree-based models).
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC where applicable.

**Notes & Next steps**
- You can try additional models, cross-validation, feature selection, or hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.
