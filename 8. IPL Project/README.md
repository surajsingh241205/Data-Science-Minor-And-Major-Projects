## Overview
This project contains an exploratory analysis of IPL match and player data. The goal is to extract insights on team and player performance, visualize trends across seasons, and provide reproducible analysis in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The repository includes `IPL.csv`, a dataset containing match-level and/or ball-by-ball data used for analysis. Inspect the notebook to see which columns are used.

## Files
- `IPL Project.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with analysis, figures, and narrative.
- `IPL.csv` — Dataset used by the notebook.
- `README.md` — This file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ recommended
- Common packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn` (if modelling)

Install dependencies (example):

```bash
python -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open `IPL Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure `IPL.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce analyses and plots.

## Notebook
The notebook contains sections for data loading, cleaning, exploratory visualizations, and (optional) simple modelling or summary statistics. Figures are embedded inline and can be exported from the notebook interface.

## Results
Key findings and plots are shown inside `IPL Project.ipynb`. You can export figures or summaries as needed.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Open an issue or submit a pull request with suggested improvements, additional analyses, or data cleaning steps.
